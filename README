The important files are triangulation.py and /data/house/SFM_on_house.py
I have updated triangulation.py to include a bundle adjustment method that uses LM.
SF_on_house.py reads in the dataset from Oxford Visual Geometry Group and has
both the GN and LM bundle adjustment methods. It can also add noise to data.
